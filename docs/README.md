## Documentation for understanding the app at its current stage (09/02/2022) AND the planned user study with the app

[Understanding the app]

1. `main_functionality.ipynb` documents the major functions of import for the main functionality of the app in terms of facilitating annotation for documents using the computational tools. Goes over the files and functions in the backend and frontend that form the core functionality, how they interconnect, a broad overview of the workflow of the entire app logic, and pointers to where the two main computational techniques - topic modeling and active learning - are implemeted and called upon in the code. 

2. `customized_settings.md` documents how and where to modify the code for modifying the settings both the app executor and the app user can use to customize the app. 

3. `known_issues.md` documents the known issues with the functioning of the app.

4. `action_items.md` documents some of the next action items especially once the known issues are fixed.


[User study materials]

1. `power_analysis/` contains the Jupyter notebooks with code to perform power analysis used to determine the number of annotators needed in various scenarios to run a well-powered user study. 

2. `IRB_approval_docs/` contains the final docs that got IRB approval for the user study (and can also help understand some of the larger goals connected with the app).
